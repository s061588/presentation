\section{Exercise 1. A look at some of the different mechanism}
If you haven't then I would recommend to install Wireshark or try a test case with tcpdump to start sniffing and detecting network traffic.


\section{Exercise 2. Snort rules}
Lets write some simple snort rules

\section{Exercise 2. Suricata}
Simple suricata setup and listening.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item install suricata, older system directly from many repo-managers,
	\item in newers add the ppa.
	\item setup the /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml on newer and restart service
	\item older uses oinkmaster and just run suricate on your interface.
\end{enumerate}

the rules are made with an action (alert, drop, pass, reject , ... ), a protocol (tcp, udp, http, ssh, dns, smb, ... ), a dest/src (direction as well) and a port.

try something like alert tcp \$your\_address any -> \$dst\_address any (msg:" ... ";flow:established,to\_server;)

then add it to some\_rule, then add your new rule and path to /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml and run suricata -c /etc/suricata/suricata.yaml -i \$interface
